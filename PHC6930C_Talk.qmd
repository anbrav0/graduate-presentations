## Objectives

Because I come from the research collection world, we're going to talk about a few things that i do:

-   Study designs and your protocol
-   Understanding the beginnings of data collection
-   Challenges with data/data collection
-   How to (intro) data science with your data (the meat of todays topic)

# Study Design and protocol

## what is it that you want to do?

::: {style="font-size:25px"}
-   What are you trying to investigate?

    -   Ex: what are factors that contribute to achievement gaps?

    -   Ex: Do certain activities in school lead to better health outcomes?

    -   Does the use of alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco lead to use of other substances?

-   What is the significance of your design?

-   What does the research say about your topic?

-   It is important to be familiar with what other scientists have discovered so far.

-   Are there any gaps in the work?

    -   For ex: problem: there is a lot of data on childhood outcomes and diseases, but a lot of the research sometimes is after infection/or the disease has already progressed or already symptomatic. Solution -\> understand the social, emotional, and behavioral activities through time (longitudinal) of a youth through their childhood, adolescent, and early adult development, so what are some of the factors that may have led to these events.

## Launching a study protocol

::: panel-tabset
### your sample

::: {style="font-size:25px"}
What does your funding look like? What is the greatest number of samples you can have given your funding, to detect an effect? (Power analysis)

-   Who are you recruiting? Are you working with human subjects? Animal subjects? Kids, adults, vulnerable populations? (recruitment and enrollment)
    -   Ex: If your working with kids, how does their school schedule affect their ability to participate in the study, how will the study accommodate?
    -   Who is/was eligible and ineligible to participate in the study? (inclusion exclusion criteria)
        -   Ex: we are interested in investigating the association between suicidality and ADHD diagnosis, children diagnosed with tic-disorder are not eligible to participate.

### recruitment site

-   Who is running your protocol? Is this a multi-site study? (e.g., many sites will be recruiting participants)

-   how many times will you be collecting this data? (is this supposed to be a longitudinal design? (more than one time point collected) cohort design?

### your protocol

-   What will the interviews/protocol be like? How long will they take? What type of data are you collecting and why? (more on this later)
    -   For ex: the ABCD protocol is a comprehensive set of physical, cognitive and social emotional, behavioral and academic assessments in addition to a neuroimaging and biospecimen analysis done either annually or bi-annually for 10 year through the child's life.

### data

what type of data are you collecting?

::: {style="font-size:25px"}
-   Sociodemographic variables? (age, income, gender, sex assigned at birth, migration status, relationship status, employment status)
-   Anthropometric data (height, weight, waist measurement?)
-   Family environment data? ( Family environmental Scale (FES: https://www.mindgarden.com/96-family-environment-scale)
-   Cultural value scales? (MACVS: https://elcentro.sonhs.miami.edu/research/measures-library/macvs/index.html)
-   Biological specimen? (hair urine, saliva, blood, blood samples?)
-   Neurocognitive tasks? (RAVLT, EST NIH-TB?)
-   Neuroimaging? (MRI Scan)

# Proposing your study üìö

## Steps

::: panel-tabset
### aims

Determine your aims

-   Ex: Determine social, behavioral, and emotional mechanisms that promote childhood well-being.
-   Ex: Address intentional injuries across lifespan to understand associated risk factors of violence and injury epidemiology.
    -   Ex: Define the parameters of Type II Diabetes that include risk factors, in order to develop an effective wellness plan.

### power

::: {style="font-size:25px"}
-   In real life, you will not be able to measure the entire K-12 population of the U.S. to determine children's social, behavioral, and emotional mechanisms. Instead, you will need to do a power sample analysis.
    -   Used to determine the adequate sample size by researchers to determine how many subjects/participants/observations are needed to answer your research question (null hypothesis) and avoid type I and Type II errors.

### timeline 

- how long will this study be running? for two years, three years?


### conclusion

::: {style="font-size:25px"}

why is this important to do? What is the significance of this?

-	Ex: what are factors that contribute to achievement gaps?
-	Ex: Do certain activities in school lead to better health outcomes?
-	Ex: Does the use of alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco lead to use of other substances?

	A lot of the reason human subject research is investigated is in the hopes of leading to new policies and interventions/decisions about the study population: 
   	- what are factors that contribute to achievement gaps?
   	    - Leads to policy decision in curricula and other programs
   	    
    - How prevalent is traumatic brain injury (TBI) in student athletes?
        - Assessment, education, precautions and changes in student athletics
	      
    -	Does the use of alcohol and marijuana and tobacco lead to use of other substances?
        - Leads to substance use prevention and early interventions.
